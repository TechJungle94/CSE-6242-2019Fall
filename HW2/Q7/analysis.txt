1. Ease to develop for developers [40 words]
	D3: Worst! The data type and grammar is a mess!
	Tableau: Best. You can start with basic knowledge about table.
	python: Medium. Start with learning Matplotlib. The datatype in python is clear and it has strong library to visualize.

2. Ease to maintain the visualization for developers (e.g., difficulty of the maintenance of the product as the requirements change, the data changes, the hosting platform changes, etc.) [40 words]
	D3: Worst! Even the grammar changed when new version comes out!
	Tableau: Medium. New version can open old one and can also save as the old one.
	python: Medium. New version usually brings new functions instead of changing the gramma.

3. Usability of visualization developed for end users [40 words]
	D3: Best. Save as html and everyone can enjoy and interact with it.
	Tableau: Worst. You can enjoy the picture but having expensive Tableau will be better.
	Python: Medium. You can enjoy the picture but having free python will be better.

4. Scalability of visualization to ¡°large¡± datasets [40 words]
	D3: Medium. SVG DOM elements eat too much of RAM (according to the literature).
	Python: Medium. Run in one kernel, speed is not so ideal.
	Tableau: Born for big data!

5. System requirements to run the visualization (e.g., browsers, OS, software licensing) for end users [40 words]
	D3: You need a browser and set its ¡°privacy.file_unique_origin¡± or have a local sever.
	Python: you need to install python and import library like Matplotlib.
	Tableau: You need to pay a lot of money for Tableau : )
