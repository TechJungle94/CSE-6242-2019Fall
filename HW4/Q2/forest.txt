1. What is the main reason to use a random forest versus a decision tree? (<= 50 words)
Random forest is more robust than a decision tree. When we train every tree in the random forest, we generate training data randomly to avoid getting similar tree, which enhance the diversity of forest. Also, decision tree is prone to overfitting.
2. How long did your random forest take to run? (in seconds)
210.54995710000003 s
3. What accuracy (to two decimal places, xx.xx%) were you able to obtain?
97.50%
